n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that allows users to connect various services and automate tasks. It provides a visual interface for creating workflows, enabling users to design complex automations without needing extensive programming knowledge. n8n supports a wide range of integrations with popular applications and services, making it a versatile solution for automating repetitive tasks and streamlining processes.

Post setup, you may need to change permissions on the `n8n-data` and `db-data` directories to ensure that the n8n service can write to them. You can do this by running:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /root/n8n
```
This command grants read, write, and execute permissions to all users for the `n8n` directory and its contents, which is necessary for n8n to function correctly.
